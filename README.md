Glass Type Identification Project
Overview
This project aims to predict the type of glass used for windows based on chemical composition data. The dataset contains various chemical properties of glass samples, and a machine learning model is built to classify the type of glass.

Project Workflow
Data Collection: The glass dataset was collected, containing information on chemical values of different glass samples.

Model Building: A machine learning model was developed using Python's scikit-learn library to predict the type of glass based on the provided chemical properties.

Web Application Development: Using the Django framework, a web application was created to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting the type of glass.

GitHub Repository: The project was version-controlled using GitHub, facilitating collaboration and tracking changes throughout development.

Dockerization: The machine learning model and web application were Dockerized to ensure consistency in deployment across different environments.

Deployment: The Docker image was deployed to Docker Hub under the repository name rithika054/my-django-app. Additionally, the web application was deployed to the Render platform for public access.
